#opensurvey
An open source app to create modern and clean surveys, monitor responses and evaluate data.
You can see the app live here: https://opensurvey.herokuapp.com

##Suggestions?

##Contribute?
The app was built using Angular 1.4.7, NodeJS with Express 4.13.3 and MongoDB 3.0.2. You can go ahead and use this code as a base to continue development on your own or contribute to this repository. As this project has been a learning project for me, please be aware that the code might be messy and not perfectly commented at all times. I'm still revisiting the codebase in order to make contributions to the repo easier.
